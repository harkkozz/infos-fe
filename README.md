# Infos FE

## Description

This is the front-end for Infos, a platform where you can register and create some desired company information so anyone can look at it easily. You can find a company without any registration and see contact info, but you can't edit, delete, or create a company. You can edit and delete a company only if you're the author of that company. If you are authorized, you can create companies.
